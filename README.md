# Tooling

These scripts will let you create and use a dockerised version of `c4builder`, a command line tool to generate pretty system documentation (including diagrams) from plain text source files:

```
├── c4builder   # Binstub to run the docker image
├── Dockerfile  # Dockerfile for dockerised c4builder
├── Makefile    # Script to build and install the docker image
└── README.md   # This file
```
